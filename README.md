Hi, here are xDShot's (https://steamcommunity.com/id/xdshot2) CS:GO Knives converted to TTT by me, Skittles9823 (https://steamcommunity.com/id/skittles9823)

====Instructions====

1. Subscribe to xDShot's CS:GO Knives swep here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506283460
2. If you don't already have it, download GMAD Extractor here: http://www.treesoft.dk/gmod/gmad/
3. Once you open GMAD hit the "Open" button then "Browse" then navigate to your garrysmod installation. (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons)
4. Click on the ID/Name/Author/Description section to make sure the addon is selected for extracting then click "Select"
5. Click "Extract All" in the top banner and find a place to store the files. (You can delete the Lua folder you just extracted as we will be using the Lua I made for this.)
6. Navigate inside the "garrysmod/addons" directory on your server installation.
7. Drop the csgo_knives folder here.
8. Find the folders you extracted (materials, models and sound) and drop them inside the csgo_knives folder.
9. Restart your server and test.
10. As xDShot said: --YOU'RE WINNER!
